== pysieved: Python Managesieve Server ==

This is a GPL managesieve server.  It uses a plug-in architecture to
support different authentication, homedir lookup, and storage
back-ends.

I wrote this so I could use avelsieve (SquirrelMail) with Postfix
and Dovecot.  It should work with other managesieve clients too.
Please share with me your successes and failures.


Plugin architecture
-------------------

The server ships with the following plug-ins:

Authentication:

* Dovecot
* PAM
* SASL
* MySQL

Homedir lookup & session initiation:

* Dovecot
* /etc/passwd
* MySQL
* simple virtual hosting (eg. /var/lib/virtual/username)

Storage:

* Dovecot


Additional back-ends are easy to write, just copy one of the existing
back-ends and start hacking.  No modifications are needed to any
existing code, so you don't have to worry about things like the 
managesieve protocol or forking.
